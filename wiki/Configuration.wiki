=Notes on the configuration files=
The configuration files are depicted with 
https://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/overview/config.jpg
on the [overview].
Examples are available in the conf folder of the download.
To get the latest versions download raw files from the 
[https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Ftest%2Fresources resources]

The .arq files contain 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL SPARQL]http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png
queries to generate reports.
Some of these files contain placeholders: `'%s'`. 
The placeholders should be replaced with the ID of an entity, for example `'@I123@'`. The original plugins for [http://genj.sourceforge.net/ GenJ]http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png
and 
[http://www.ancestris.org/ Ancestris]http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png
perform the replacements on the flight when a report is launched from the context of an entity. 
The library needs clones of these files with hard coded IDs.

The .rules depicted for `convert` don't produce sensible output with  `transform`. The result of `convert` is not intended for publication on the web. When [OntologiesAndRules customizing] rules for `transform`, it can be convenient to test them with `convert`.

The kml-xxx.arq files can also be used with the `select` command, while customizing the output it can be convenient to first test the results of the query.

.html as output makes .xsl mandatory input, the example mentioned in [https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/wiki/Localizing#Headers Localize] creates a straightforward table. 

Note that you may also host a kml map on you own website, search the web for how-to's.
