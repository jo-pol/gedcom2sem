= Why does the converter need URI's? =
The semantic web uses URIs to identify objects. The ID's of gedcom entities are inserted into URI's for that purpose. When your GedCom is published somewhere with a page per entity (such as I12 for an INDI and F34 for a FAM), it is good practice to use these URL's as URI. For entities that don't have pages invent URI's with a similar construction that will not be used for another purpose.

URI versus URL (in short): A URI is an _identifier_, it is unique, might but need not resolve to a web-page. A URL is a _locater_ and does resolve to a web page.

Try the mashup query dbpediaLanguages.arq Note that not all can be queried directly.

= What properties are commonly available? =
Try the mashup [https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Freports%2Fmashup queries]:
  *      geonamesProperties.arq
  *      geonamesRelatedEntities.arq
  *      dbpediaRelatedEntities.arq
  *      dbpediaProperties.arq

You probably saved the arq file as an UTF-8 with a byte-order-mark. Typically Window's `NotePad` adds that BOM when you choose to save as UTF-8. Normaly these bytes do not show, but with the command "type" in a command window, they show up as funny characters. Try to save as ANSII.
