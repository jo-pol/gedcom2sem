<h1>Modeling your data</h1>

When preparing your data for the semantic web, the first step is choose or create an ontology.
However, that is not the last choice to make. 
The set of rules provided for the transform command is just one possible outcome of the proces.

=Ontologies or RDF schemas=

Some ontologies that surfaced from a quick survey:

It has an apparently abandoned [http://web.archive.org/web/20041214001231/http://orlando.drc.com/daml/Ontology/Genealogy/3.1/Gentology-ont.daml variant]http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png More background on http://jay.askren.net/Projects/SemWeb/

=Indirect relations=

A resource describing a person in a family tree 
will usually contain children, spouses and parents, 
but maybe also siblings, grandparents and grandchildren. 
However, these indirect relations produce a mess when shown in a graph,
even with just three generations.

the interactive [http://en.lodlive.it/?http://gothwin.data.seme4.com/id/person/I0243 graph]


=Inverse relations=

When presenting your data with a SPARQL endpoint for querying, 
you could decide to store the spouse relation with just one of both involved persons.
But when crawling the web (as for example with the LodLive graph), 
it is usefull to have all indirect relations at hand.
