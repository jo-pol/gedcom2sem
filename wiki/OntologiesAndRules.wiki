=Ontologies and rules=

==Introduction==

The first conversion step merely turns gedcom tags into predicates without thoughts about semantics. The approach results into conflicts, for example the title of a person is another concept (social rank: Mrs., Dr., Sir) than the title of a multimedia object which is rather a catchy phrase. Rules can derive new statements that respect an established ontology. Drop the original statements and you can get a valid semantic document. Thus you can model the data any way you want. Ontologies that surfaced from a quick survey:

==Status==

The basic rules and additional rules were designed to simplify writing reports without any consideration about ontologies. Probably the reporting queries can be rewritten with the bio/foaf model once the rules are completed. An [https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/gedcom2sem/gedsem/Publish.java experimental alternative] for the convert command drops the original statements.
