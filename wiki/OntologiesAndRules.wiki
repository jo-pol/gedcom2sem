=Ontologies and rules=

==Introduction==

The first conversion step merely turns gedcom tags into predicates without thoughts about semantics. The approach results into conflicts, for example the title of a person is another concept (social rank: Mrs., Dr., Sir) than the title of a multimedia object which is rather a catchy phrase. Rules can derive new statements that respect an ontology of your choice. Drop the original statements and you can get a valid semantic document. Thus you can model the data any way you want. Some ontologies that surfaced from a quick survey:
  * http://www.daml.org/2001/01/gedcom/gedcom is simple but uses only a fraction of the information that can be stored in a gedcom. It has an apparently abandoned [http://web.archive.org/web/20041214001231/http://orlando.drc.com/daml/Ontology/Genealogy/3.1/Gentology-ont.daml variant]http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png.

==Status==

An [https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/gedcom2sem/gedsem/Publish.java experimental alternative] for the convert command drops the original statements. A mapping to foaf/bio statements is under development. Notes and sources are not yet figured out.

The [https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/source/browse/trunk/src/main/resources/rules/BasicRules.txt basic rules] and [https://code.google.com/p/gedcom2sem/source/browse/trunk/src/main/resources/rules/AdditionalRules.txt additional rules] were designed to simplify writing reports without any consideration about ontologies. It makes no sense to drop original statements in this case. NB: specify the additional rules after the basic rules.

==Customization==

When you upload your gedcom to some community or publish it yourself, you might want to link to that publication with an additional rule. In the following examples you should replace at least `SOMENAME` with a value related to your account or publication.
