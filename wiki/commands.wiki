Whether the library is or is not plugged into your favorite gedcom-application, you can allways use the library on a command line. 

=jar-folder=
To prepare comand line execution, create a folder and download the following files into the folder:
  * The latest jar in the download section of this project
  * [https://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/main/resources/log4j.properties log4j.properties]
  * The jar files in the screenshot.<br> In practice you need at least gedcom4j, jena-arq, jena-core, jena-iri, xercesImpl, xml-apis, JavaAPIforKML, jaxb-api, log4j, slf4j-api, slf4j-log4j.<br> You can search for the jars for example on http://mvnrepository.com/ Beware of advertisements with download buttons, carefully look for the links in the table below the banner.

=command line=

Below a partial command line example. The ovals in the diagram on the [overview] page represent such commands. Replace the dots (...) with the  files from the same diagram. Put the output file last; the order of rules files is significant: they may need the results of a previous one. 
{{{
java -Xmx1024M -cp jar-folder/* gedcom2sem.semweb.Select ...
}}}

_Note_: on windows the slash should be in the other direction.

_Hint_: for quick and easy execution you can put the desired commands in a file. On Windows in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file">.bat http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png</a> file, on Mac/Unix in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">.sh http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png</a> file ._
