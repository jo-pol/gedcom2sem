The original plugins in <a href="http://genj.sourceforge.net/">GenJ http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png</a> and <a href="http://www.ancestris.org/">Ancestris http://gedcom2sem.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki-images/icon_external_link_blue.png</a> still lack the enhancements for mash ups and KML. The command line interface of this library is not very suitable for end users. Plugin developers could plug this library back into both applications and into other applications that choose so. 

The main classes are identified on the [overview] page, they are a good starting point to explore the possibilities.

=design suggestions=

==options per gedcom==

  * name and location of converted gedcom
  * name and location of geoMashup.rules and geoNamesCache (and something to guide createing them)
  * checkbox: save the converted gedcom whenever the gedcom itself is saved (especially with all the rules applied it takes a while, prevent blocking GUI processing)

== menu commands ==

  * a menu command to save the converted gedcom

== report dialog ==

Invoked from the general menu or the context menu of an entity. The OK button of the dialog invokes: Select.

Controls:
  * An entity chooser. When the dialog was opened from a context menu of an entity, that instance should be initialy selected. 
  * drop down lists / file choosers for the arguments shown on the [overview] page
  * Edit box[es?] for the chosen arguments. Line numbers may help fix syntax errors.

Disable/hide built in queries that conflict with the selected type of entity. A "%s" in a query should be replaced by the selected entity.

Disable/hide built in queries that need more rules than have been applied with the last conversion of the gedcom.

A mistake in a query might cause to execute forever. It should be executed in a subprocess that can be killed when the users chooses so. Same applies to conversion with custom rules.
