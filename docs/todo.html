            The triples get meanings with ontologies (also expressed in triples)
            though a human can guess a lot without following the mathematical definitions.
            The mother of all ontologies is OWL. An ontology also implies inference. 
            For example: A isAncesterOf B, B isAncestorOf C -> A isAncestorOf C.
            At the moment applying full-fledged inference is slow. Common practice
            is to apply just the rules you actually need.
