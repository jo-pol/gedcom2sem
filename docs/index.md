In the snapshots below, the map and reports on top are generated by this library.

In the center a preconfigured query for reports.

At the right bottom sits a toddler version of the [LOD-cloud](http://lod-cloud.net/):
The fragment highlights some interesting data to combine with your family tree,
a filtered list is available at the [datahub](http://datahub.io/tag/genealogy)

The left bottom shows the result of a short [LodLive](http://en.lodlive.it)
demonstration: start with a French page on
[JFK](http://en.lodlive.it/?http://fr.dbpedia.org/resource/John_Fitzgerald_Kennedy),
follow the link to the same page in the English dbpedia (read: another family tree) and subsequently follow spouse and children.

Try for your self:
* download the last [release](https://github.com/jo-pol/gedcom2sem/releases)
* unzip
* on windows 
  * open a command prompt
  * go into the unzipped directory
  * run `convert.bat`
  * this results in the file `kennedy.ttl`, it is needed by the next commands
  * run `kml.bat`, this results in the file `kennedy.kml`, show it with a kml-viewer
  * `html-repot.bat` results in a file `kennedy-age-diffs.html` which you can view with a browser
* Mac/*nix users need to bypass a bug in the `*.sh` files:
  * delete `-SNAPSHOT` from `-cp gedcom2sem-0.2.3-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  * otherwise the same story as with the `*.bat` files on windows

Examine the developers overview,
[BatchExamples](https://github.com/jo-pol/gedcom2sem/blob/master/src/test/java/gedcom2sem/BatchExamples.java)
