            The SPARQL based reports allow to write and customise reports
            without a development environment. As a side effect you get your
            GedCom converted into an RDF file. When published the RDF file
            could be used in cross-site queries for mash-ups.

        <p class="justify">
            The report generation undergoes four stages:
        <ol>
            <li>conversion (optional)
                <ul>
                    <li>from GedCom format to your choice of <a href="rdf-about.html#rdf-about_6">RDF / TTL / N3</a>,
                        and from ID's in the GedCom file to <a href="rdf-about.html#rdf-about_4">URI</a>'s in the converted file
                    </li>
                    <li>apply <a href="rdf-about.html#rules">rules</a> (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>execute the SPARQL <a href="rdf-about.html#queries">query</a></li>
            <li>apply a nice <a href="rdf-about.html#rdf-about_5">layout</a> (optional)</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <i><b>(1)</b> Reload the previous conversion result if the GedCom did not
        change and the new query works with the last applied rules.<br>
        <b>(3)</b> Choose TXT as output extension for a simple table layout.</i>

        <a name="queries"></a>
        <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">2 - Queries</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            <a href="./rdf-examples.html">Examples</a>
        </p>         
        <p class="justify">
          Delivered examples were initially intended to show the most important techniques.
          Such as counting, sorting, computing, filtering and navigating through the data.
        </p>
        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">a - customizing</h4>
        <p class="justify">
          Some examples may contain comment with hints about variations, rather than duplicate
          the query. Save the query between your documents as a plain text file
          and apply the desired adjustments.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          You are free to experiment with the queries, 
          but note that a simple typo may cause the query to return nothing.
          A clumsy query may take for ever to execute and currently there is 
          no way to stop it other than shutting down ancestris from outside.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            Examining the converted GedCom can help with further customization and with 
            developing new queries. Choose extension n3 or ttl for the converted file.
            These formats have a lot in common with the SPARQL
            query language. See also the

        <h4 class="ancestris_help_title">b - localizing</h4>
        <p class="justify">
          For public queries the best approach is descibed on 
          the <a href="./rdf-submit.html">submission</a> page.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          Localizing the result can also be done by changing column headings as described below. 
          Related problems are dates and names stored in various formats. 
          Queries would become too complex and slow to cater for all these and other variations.
          Once a query is forked for a translation, each variant would evolve along its own route
          like wikipedia articles do.
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
          A general hint about the column headings:<br/>
          Between SELECT and the first "{", you will see constructs like 
          <i>&lt;expression&gt;</i> or like <i>(&lt;expression&gt; as ?columnName)</i>.
          By convention one per line.
          You can change the former into the latter, and you can choose 
          your own column names. Choose the names with care, they should 
          not occur anywhere else in the query.
          When you save a query as UTF-8 to cater for proper column names,
          the file should not be saved with a BOM (Byte order mark) such as Windows' Notepad does.
        </p>
        <a name="rules"></a>
        <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">3 - Rules</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            Some queries become easier when the conversion is extended with
            rules. In words such a rule may sound like "the wife and husband
            in a family are spouses" or "a child is a descendant, a descendant
            of a descendant is also an descendant".
        </p>
        <p class="justify">
            Computing all descendants and all ancestors of all individuals
            may take minutes. The execution time grows exponentially with the
            size of your database. Therefore we
            have two set of rules, the quick rules don't generate ancestor/descendant
            relations. Without any rules, conversion is at it fastest, but
            only few queries will execute, with the slow rules any query
            should execute. An alternative for the slow rules is rewrite the queries 
            and make use of custom tags like _SOSA and _TREETOP
            that can be generated with other tools.

        <h3 class="ancestris_help_title">6 - RDF / TTL / N3</h3>
        <p class="justify">
            The extension determines the stored format. 
            For local queries it doesn't matter which one you choose.
            For cross site queries RDF is recommend as the most commonly supported.
            TTL and N3 are almost as easy to read as 
            GedCom mode of Ancestris' edit view. These two formats also have a lot in common
            with the query syntax.
